# kiosk-imageJ-plugin
The goal is to submit images to an existing Kubernetes cluster, get results, identify folder for batch submission, and ID workflow

## Ideally, you should use this if:
* You use imageJ,
* You want to submit individual files for deep cell jobs straight from your directory without navigating the site,
* You want to submit individual directories with images for deep cell jobs straight from your directory without navigating the site, and
* You want to give a undergraduate student helpful feedback on usability.

## To run this:
* As of now here's what you do:
1. Get the jar from a link that will be posted here.
2. Run the jar.
3. You will get an option to select whether to upload individual files or directories.
4. You will then get an option to select the job type you want, from the available job types deep cell supports.
5. You will then get an option to specify how long you want to wait for your job.
6. You wait. For success and hopefully a download url that will be displayed, or failure with hopefully a reason why.
